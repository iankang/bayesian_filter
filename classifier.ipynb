      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of an ongoing NASA/UAH joint project, Dr. John Christy of UAH and Dr. Roy Spencer of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center use data gathered by microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration TIROS-N satellites to get accurate, direct measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the Earth, including remote deserts, rain forests and oceans for which reliable temperature data are not otherwise available.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data. A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a \"public\" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n",

      "GATHERING THE DATA\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their \"brightness\" - varies according to temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a \"remarkable\" level of agreement between the two.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by \"radiosonde\" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement,\" Christy said. \"If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23° Fahrenheit) per decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet,\" Christy said. \"They are not representative of the total globe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05° C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.\n",

      "GLOBAL COVERAGE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. \"Radiosonde\" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard \"ships of opportunity.\" The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.\n",

Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local \"asphalt effect\" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.\n",

      "Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weve never seen anything like it!\n",

XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon.\n",

      "After thirty?three years of being a black man living in \"Ghetto America,\" an environment notorious for danger, crime, and poverty, I have made startling discoveries involving young African?American men and women who comprise what I have come to define as the \"Black Generation X\". I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African?Americans from the general definition of \"Generation X\". Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed \"Baby Boomers\", it's important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well. Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African?American culture, I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth, childhood, and young adult life. Taken from a web site entitled \"Generation X\", created and maintained by the Colorado College, the definition is as follows: \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " \"We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981. We are individuals who live for the 'here and now', like to experiment, and who require immediate results. We are typically selfish, and cynical, and depend a lot on our parents. We question authority, and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations. It's that simple. It seems we have come to be called \"Xer's\" simply because we represent something negative to our elders. We may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common, that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings. Of course, they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility, or actually their fault. Our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us. Intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school. It appears we have little hope for the future. No jobs, no homes, and basically no money are almost expected of us. These bleak prospects, along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever, do not provide much hope. Some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life, but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood, as our saviors. We will soon discover who is right and who is wrong.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that Generation X is comprised of one core group of American citizens. It over generalizes the similarities it expresses, and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years. When in fact these \"similarities\" speak primarily to only \"white\" issues and concerns. For instance, \"they\" say \"we\" depend a lot on our parents, but in ghetto America \"we\" could only depend on one ",
      "our mothers! \"They\" also say, \" . . .we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations,\" and \" . . . we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever.\" In ghetto America, no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now, and is all \"we\" have time for. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have known for many years that the differences that separate Generation Xer's black and white occupants would eventually be identified. I never knew I would be the one doing it. Extracting the \"Black\" from \"Generation X\" and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency. Without doing so, the social ills that plague Ghetto America would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective American identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many hidden truths that exist in black America today. \"White America\" charges that we spend our time collecting welfare, refusing to vote, reading elementary styled books, watching music videos, day dreaming of becoming rappers, basketball players, selling drugs, and making babies. Much of this is supported in Marlon Riggs's documentary entitled \"Ethnic Notions.\" When African Americans are mentioned, whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book. A reality that I confirmed while watching \"Roger & Me,\" another documentary written, and directed by Michael Moore. Sadly, many of us have begun to validate this skewed image, while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind, only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for B.E.T. (Black Entertainment Television). Many of us fail to realize, that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex\n",
      "\n",
      " posed truth may reveal, should be taken as an opportunity to improve, empower, enlighten, and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding Black Women: I have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities, I began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole-that black men owed them something, and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives, be it emotional, physical, or economical.\n",
      "\n",
      " Normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me, so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended. In most cases, it has not been. It's funny though, looking back, I am surprised I never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to, or the various schools of thought they possessed. Many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the African?American male, some fair and some unfair. Much of what the public believes and understands about the black female's social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is. \n",
      "\n",
      "What originally sparked my attention was an observation I stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction. I noticed virtually all of the books I read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent African?American perspective. These stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all African?Americans thrive on a middle?to?upper class professional level. They relay stories of relationship problems with \"Huxtable?like\" bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love. As I read these stories I couldn't help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or \"working class\" African?Americans. Although there are those in the black community that can identify with the \"Huxtable?like\" dynamic, unfortunately, they are few and far between. \n",
      "\n",
      "The majority of stories I have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued Black America. The black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our \"dirty laundry\". The fact is, truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind. \n",
      "\n",
      "I recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in, they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal. As our discussion intensified, I reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed, and oftentimes, not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself. \n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self?destructive thinking and self?imprisoning behavior that \"black male and female generation X\" have been subscribing to. While discussing this with my friend, she suggested I simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what I'm attempting to convey. Acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood, I suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative-to grab a dictionary. (Don't feel bad-there were several times I had to as well!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding Black Men: An overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool, buying sports wear, driving expensive cars, wearing gold or platinum jewelry, and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions! I have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of African?American culture because I have lived it. I have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level. It is a world of ignorance, selfishness, pre?occupation, and idiocy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my world there are people who applaud a lack of education, who brag about having served time in U.S. penitentiaries, the types of guns they carry, dope peddling, and chasing women. They champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit. In this world, wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they've got a million. It's a world where children dress in over?priced sports wear, mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking, such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one's self?worth, and the possible corruption this thinking breeds, seems to not be an important concern for black mothers. It may come as a shock to know that most African?Americans feel that those who don't have the same, if not better, material possessions, are lesser beings, referring to them as being corny, lame, or broke. Even our \"male rapper\" entertainers promote backward priorities-nothing else matters as long as you look good. \"The Big Tymers\", a popular rap duo, have a song called \"I'm Still Fly\", shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country. (\"Fly\" is ghetto vernacular for well dressed, also used to describe a female's beauty). Its signature verse asserts:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I got gator boots with a pimped out Gucci\n",
      "\n",
      "Suit, can't pay my rent cause all my money's\n",
      "\n",
      "spent, but that's O.K. cause I'm still fly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Worse yet, in the song \"Grinding\", the popular duo \"Eclipse\" glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video. (The term \"grinding\" is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs) The fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil. Some of the key lyrics to this song are \"grinding",
      "you know what I keep in the lining\" (the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs) and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Patty cake Patty cake I'm the bakers man\n",
      "\n",
      "I bake them cakes as fast as I can\n",
      "\n",
      "and you can tell cause of how my bread stack up\n",
      "\n",
      "and I disguise it as rap so the feds backup\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In this verse, the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack. When created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake. (hence the term \"cake\" or sometimes \"pie\") Unfortunately for the rap genre, this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders, who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law. \n",
      "\n",
      "The negative references I've identified have become an integral part of the urban African?American existence. This mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable. This ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has. There is an overwhelming part of the African?American community that is aware of this crippling mentality. There are also many that are unaware and unfortunately, more that do not even care. Those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily. Whether because of habit or misguided values, this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance. It should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us. We must save ourselves! I am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now, and are thinking, what right do I have to express the opinions I have thus far, as well as those I have al\n",
      "\n",
      " luded too. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content. There is far too much negativity thriving within our culture. There must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth, whether good or bad. I am aware that not all of \"us\" have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community, and I have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life. Any similarities and generalizations I illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, throughout this book I will refer to African?Americans in four different ways; the first being \"African?Americans\", denoting our status as citizens in the United States; secondly, as \"Black\", a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country; third, as \"Niggas,\" a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with \"Nigger\". The term \"nigga\" has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship (hence the term \"My Nigga\") as well as a blanket reference when speaking to, of, or about other black males in a non?personal manner. I felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences I will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place; and fourth, as \"Ghetto\", this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the\n",
      "\n",
      "  less polished members of our community.  It is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such. \n",
      "\n",
      "My commentary is based on real?life situations, both good and bad, and how one African?American man was affected by them. To that end, I feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals I have encountered. Despite the negativity they have displayed, I only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to, in many ways, has caused them to become their own worst enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of the black female's negative and limited perspective toward black men, the world, and subconsciously themselves, I submit that this mentality is perhaps single?handedly responsible for the lack of success, happiness, and quality of life that is at the center of every African?American woman's fantasy quest. It is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men, has been deliberately created by \"White America\". For example, much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day. Many past issues have taken on new identities and have re?emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men. The resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate America, without realizing and ackno\n",
      "\n",
      " wledging that this absence is by design. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are other \"core\" issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation, such as color barriers, light skin versus dark skin, good hair versus bad hair, loyalty, devotion, and economic status. Believe it or not, there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn't sell drugs or was not \"thugged out\". (a term for being rough or hoodlum-like) The reasoning behind it being that the \"thug,\" and \"drug dealer\" lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence. \n",
      "\n",
      "These issues, among others, relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society. Sadly that \"confused mentality\" is responsible for much of the neglect the African American \"ghetto\" community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren. Who have locked it away in the basement, and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that \"ghetto America does not exist. Furthermore, the lack of acknowledgement of which I speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the African American community.  Their plight is a well-known reality, but in many cases much of ghetto America falls under that same umbrella. Be advised: this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into \"Black America\".  Rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young African Americans (including myself) have come to perpetuate. Moreover, that \"backward thinking\" is the main \n",
      "\n",
      " cause of our inability to strive for a common goal. An outcome that must be met; and can only be met, with Godly faith, positive strategy, cooperation, love, loyalty, self and mutual respect.\n",

      " I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. \n",
      "\n",
      "On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. \n",
      "\n",
      "On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. \n",
      "\n",
      "According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.\n",
      "\n",
      " I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. \n",
      "\n",
      "Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\n",
      "\n",
      " Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. \n",
