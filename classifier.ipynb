The freight still isn't moving, factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing day. \", \"\\n\\nOn Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax\\n\\ndosages.\", '\\n\\nInvoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew Iraq would be in here somewhere). \"Union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10-day shutdown,\" said the L.A. Times, but an anonymous Bush administration official \"said that only a portion of\\n\\nwhat the Defense Department needs has made it ashore.\"', '\\n\\nPolitically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the other hand, \"Voter discontent with Bush\\'s handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the Republican administration,\" said the San Francisco Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the\\n\\neconomy. \"Though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy, andmerited federal intervention,\" said the AP. ', \"\\n\\nAs for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case). One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers' contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78 days until Christmas.

If I instead try to sell a homebuilt guitar\\n\\non eBay with \"Gibson\" written in crayon on the headstock, and then\\n\\nclaim it is a true Les Paul limited edition, I expect people would get\\n\\nupset.\\n\\n\\n\\n    M> Why is it that people don\\'t understand that giving stuff away\\n\\n    M> is a perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  \\n\\n\\n\\nTo play the Devil\\'s Advocate here, it\\'s not about giving /stuff/ away,\\n\\nit is about granting endless and cascading duplication/distribution\\n\\nrights.  Even if _I_ only make the copy I give to you, that doesn\\'t\\n\\nstop you from making 10000 copies to sell.\\n\\n\\n\\n    M> Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  \\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the difficult question:  How will they draw the distinction?\\n\\nThe \"other stuff\" is just as easy to duplicate as the free stuff.\\n\\nThis is why MS is hunting people with illegal Windows; it\\'s no harder\\n\\nto dup than a Linux CD, only what is there that actually prevents\\n\\npeople from doing it?\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonally, I don\\'t think the issue should have anything to do with\\n\\nsales or units.  The issue is that basic phallacy that says a suit\\n\\nshould be able to \"own\" someone else\\'s intellectual property.  Sarah\\n\\nMcLaughlin isn\\'t suing you, it\\'s her label\\'s legal dept because it\\'s\\n\\nthe label who stands to lose; Sarah\\'s already fat beyond her wildest\\n\\ndreams, so a few bucks here or there, or even if the well dried up\\n\\ntomorrow, it\\'s not going to really traumatize her (unless she\\'s been\\n\\nblazingly stupid with her money)\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the label ... like Disney and Mickey, they need the cash cow so\\n\\nthey can keep all sorts of uncreative hangers-on in limos and coke.\\n\\nIf you thought only Elvis or Brian Jones or Dennis Wilson had problems\\n\\nwith beautiful-people deadbeat leech \"friends\" draining their riches,\\n\\nthink again.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe problem is really very simple because it is semantic, and until we\\n\\nmake the semantic flip, it\\'s unsolvable, but like trisecting an angle,\\n\\nall it takes is looking at the same situation in a different\\n\\nway.  Here\\'s the revelation: Elvis never ever made a hit record.\\n\\n\\n\\nElvis didn\\'t make the hits, his /fans/ made the hits.  His fans did\\n\\nthe work cleaning toilets, manning the convenience stores, driving\\n\\nmilk trucks, sitting at endless office desks, they did the /real/\\n\\nlabour that paid for every last one of Elvis Presley\\'s pills.  All\\n\\nElvis did was sing into a microphone every so often, and pen or\\n\\ncollect the odd song that all those /people/ liked and wanted as\\n\\nsomething of their own.  But it\\'s not _Elvis_ who made them universal\\n\\nstatements, it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs into\\n\\ntheir own lives, it was pull-technology, not push.\\n\\n\\n\\nTherefore the question becomes: how many times must these fans pay\\n\\nbefore they own what they themselves have created?  They pay royalties\\n\\nfor listening to the radio, for blank tapes, for concert tickets, for\\n\\na beer in a bar with a cover band ... they pay over and over and over\\n\\nagain for the /right/ to make some hack writer\\'s song /their/\\n\\nfavourite song????  That\\'s where the whole system has been seriously\\n\\nwarped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into your\\n\\nthinking that it is the Elvis who makes the Elvis.  It\\'s not.  It\\'s\\n\\nthe people who make them; the songs are already theirs.\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\n\\nGary Lawrence Murphy ', ' TeleDynamics Communications Inc\\n\\n Business Advantage through Community Software : http://www.teledyn.com\\n\\n\"Computers are useless.

A proposed law based on the discussion \\n\\ndraft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in \\n\\nearly 2003.\\n\\n\\n\\nArguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, \\n\\nCanadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and \\n\\ncombat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting \\n\\nthese proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the \\n\\nCouncil of Europe's cybercrime treaty \\n\\n\", ', which the country is in the \\n\\nprocess of considering.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the \\n\\npossession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet \\n\\nproviders to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and \\n\\npermit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find \"hidden \\n\\nelectronic and digital devices\" that a suspect might be concealing. In \\n\\nmost circumstances, a court order would be required for government \\n\\nagents to conduct Internet monitoring.\\n\\n\\n\\nCanada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of \\n\\nEurope, and representatives from both countries\\' police agencies have \\n\\nendorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty \\n\\n', ', which has \\n\\ndrawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. \\n\\nOf nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted \\n\\n', ', \\n\\nor ratified, the treaty.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichael Geist ', ', a professor at the \\n\\nUniversity of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the \\n\\njustification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems \\n\\nweak.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It seems to me that the main justification they\\'ve given for all the \\n\\nchanges is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to \\n\\nmake changes,\" Geist said. \"To me that\\'s not a particularly convincing \\n\\nargument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, \\n\\nmake that case.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nGeist added that \"there\\'s nothing in the document that indicates (new \\n\\npowers) are needed. I don\\'t know that there have been a significant \\n\\nnumber of cases where police have run into problems.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nProbably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is \\n\\ncompelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure \\n\\ntheir networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention \\n\\norders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the \\n\\nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act \\n\\n', ', but it \\n\\napplies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and \\n\\nInternet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical \\n\\ncapability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national \\n\\nsecurity agencies,\" according to the proposal. Companies would be \\n\\nresponsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.\\n\\n\\n\\nSarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center \\n\\n', ' (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says \\n\\nthe proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. \"Their \\n\\nproposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not \\n\\njust Internet providers,\" Andrews said. \"The cybercrime treaty deals \\n\\nonly with computer data.\" EPIC opposes \\n\\n', ' \\n\\nthe cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and \\n\\ndoes not adequately respect privacy rights.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs \\n\\nof Police recommends \"the establishment of a national database\" with \\n\\npersonal information about all Canadian Internet users. \"The \\n\\nimplementation of such a database would presuppose that service \\n\\nproviders are compelled to provide accurate and current information,\" \\n\\nthe draft says.\\n\\n\\n\\nGus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an \\n\\nactivist with Privacy International, calls the database \"a dumb idea.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Immediately you have to wonder if you\\'re allowed to use anonymous \\n\\nmobile phones or whether you\\'re allowed to connect to the Internet \\n\\nanonymously,\" Hosein said.\\n\\n\\n\\nA representative for George Radwanski \\n\\n', ', Canada\\'s privacy commissioner, said \\n\\nthe office is reviewing the blueprint and does not \"have any comments on \\n\\nthe paper as it stands.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nComments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca \\n\\n', ' no later than Nov. 15.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n']\n",

Since they\\n\\nstart with \"#\" they are ignored in the final compilation.\\n\\n\\n\\nRegarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel\\n\\nsoftware to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. \\n\\nI recall from your previous mail that there was a flag\\n\\n    --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4\\n\\nwhich could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate\\n\\ndirectory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).

Bison don\\'t\\n\\nlive this high up.\\' \"\\n\\n\\n\\nKnapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,\\n\\nwhere scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a\\n\\nbison\\x96one that died about 340 years ago. \"This was an extraordinary\\n\\ndiscovery,\" says Russ Graham, the museum\\'s chief curator, adding that it\\n\\ncould alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. \"There\\'s\\n\\nprobably a lot more like it yet to be found.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd not just bison. Colorado isn\\'t the only place where glaciers and\\n\\nsnowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru\\n\\nto Alaska\\x96a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and\\n\\nindustry\\x96have shrunk or thawed many of the world\\'s 70,000 glaciers. As\\n\\nthe ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is\\n\\nemerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep\\n\\nfreeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky\\n\\nfringes of the ice are revising scientists\\' understanding of our\\n\\npredecessors\\' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through\\n\\nstudying these remains,\" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude\\n\\narchaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic\\n\\nSociety. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered\\n\\nin the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old \"Ice\\n\\nMan,\" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have\\n\\noffered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as\\n\\nthe ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional\\n\\ntreasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.\\n\\n\\n\\nVanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother\\n\\nNature\\x96and looters\\x96take them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can\\n\\ndeteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they\\'re\\n\\noften so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them\\n\\ndon\\'t even realize they\\'re ancient.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in\\n\\nBritish Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a\\n\\ndead animal. \"It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,\"\\n\\nrecalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. \"But when I looked\\n\\ncloser I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFiguring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur\\n\\ntrapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc\\n\\nbag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed\\n\\nthe fallen hunter\\'s body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what\\n\\nseemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter\\n\\nlived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts\\'inchi, or Long Ago\\n\\nPerson Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who\\n\\nmay be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human\\n\\nfrom the period ever found in North America.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could\\n\\nexplain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the\\n\\nfirst place. \"Before this there was no archaeological record of people\\n\\nliving here,\" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. \"Now we\\n\\nsee that this area was very much part of people\\'s seasonal activities.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLike Ward\\'s discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek\\n\\ncaught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,\\n\\nGerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south\\n\\nYukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in\\n\\ncaribou dung. \"It was really odd, because I knew there hadn\\'t been\\n\\ncaribou in the area for at least 100 years,\" recalls Kuzyk, then a\\n\\nwildlife biologist with the Yukon government.\\n\\n\\n\\nCaribou cake. Returning a week later, he found \"what looked like a\\n\\npencil with string wrapped around it.\" It turned out to be a\\n\\n4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the\\n\\nice patch\\x96and scores of others around the region\\x96revealed icy layer\\n\\ncakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800\\n\\nyears of changing hunting practices.\\n\\n\\n\\nScientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the\\n\\nice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.\\n\\nHunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded\\n\\nsome equipment in the ice. \"We\\'ve got people hunting with throwing darts\\n\\nup until 1,200 years ago,\" says Hare, who now oversees the research\\n\\nproject. \"Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about\\n\\n1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there\\'s no more throwing\\n\\ndarts.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNow scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They\\n\\nare developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where\\n\\nglaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to\\n\\nhave migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska\\'s Wrangell\\n\\nand St. Elias mountain ranges\\x96the United States\\' most glaciated\\n\\nterrain\\x96and in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing\\n\\nEuropean Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as\\n\\nthe Ice Man. \"Global warming is providing us high-altitude\\n\\narchaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We\\'re\\n\\nprobably about the only ones happy about it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n']\n",

But the energy\\n\\nindustry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify\\n\\nsoaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial\\n\\nand fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what\\n\\neveryone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal\\n\\nadministrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed\\n\\nsupplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after\\n\\nCalifornia's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity\\n\\ngenerators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch,\\n\\nalso driving up prices.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked\\n\\nthe system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a\\n\\nmemorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to\\n\\nrelieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any\\n\\ncongestion.''\\n\\n\\n\\nHow much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be\\n\\nseen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and\\n\\npolicy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things --\\n\\nincluding a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers'\\n\\ngrips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think\\n\\nthat the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least\\n\\nfavorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of\\n\\ntraditional, non-renewable energy sources.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any\\n\\nfruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the\\n\\nstate amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a\\n\\nreasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.\\n\\n\\n\\nState policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile.\\n\\nInstead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if\\n\\nit gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the\\n\\nutilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,''\\n\\nnotes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for\\n\\nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities --\\n\\ntempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could\\n\\nachieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better\\n\\njob. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to\\n\\ninject real competition into the market.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity\\n\\ndefies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation\\n\\nis essential.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers\\n\\ncontrol. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of\\n\\nboth.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up\\n\\nthe use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities\\n\\nwill have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable\\n\\nsources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer\\n\\nmodel we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer\\n\\nideas isn't enough.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small\\n\\ngenerators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized,\\n\\nharder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is\\n\\ncoming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.\\n\\n\\n\\nInvesting to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all.\\n\\nCalifornia should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax\\n\\nincentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't\\n\\ndone badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did\\n\\nreact to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's\\n\\nlunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it\\n\\naltogether.\\n\\n\\n\\nMaybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so\\n\\ngrossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are\\n\\nmaking us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming\\n\\nwar in Iraq goes badly.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to\\n\\ndrastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy\\n\\nsystem. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its\\n\\nown right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it\\n\\nhurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next\\n\\nyear.\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\n\\n-----------------\\n\\nR. A.

It now appears in\\n\\n> Remote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked\\n\\n> together and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoid\\n\\n> derivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.\\n\\n> The Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities\\n\\n> with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a\\n\\n> description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see\\n\\n> them. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but\\n\\n> not the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth\\n\\n> even if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a\\n\\n> renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.\\n\\n> The definitive work on dragons is \"The Flight of Dragons\" by Peter\\n\\n> Dickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long\\n\\n> bow. Targets do not come much bigger.\\n\\n> \\n\\n> Truth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer\\'s current scenario is that\\n\\n> there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard\\n\\n> their eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. They\\n\\n> survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.\\n\\n> They evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet\\n\\n> (for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves\\n\\n> but otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.\\n\\n> \\n\\n> Thus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the\\n\\n> dinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also\\n\\n> to appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remote\\n\\n> viewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds are\\n\\n> contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can be\\n\\n> encouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and\\n\\n> mind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will help\\n\\n> so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great\\n\\n> difficulty surviving reincarnation.

They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made\\n\\n> them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order to\\n\\n> keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do this\\n\\n> they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is an\\n\\n> act of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop the\\n\\n> ability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first and\\n\\n> so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They have\\n\\n> become the source of all Satans, devils and demons.\\n\\n> \\n\\n> Birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep\\n\\n> them warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and\\n\\n> only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tend\\n\\n> to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This is\\n\\n> primarily an act of love but inward looking.

This is especially true as a mammalian female\\n\\n> can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird\\n\\n> sitting on a nest.\\n\\n> \\n\\n> Dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,\\n\\n> while birds and mammals developed love.

A proposed law based on the discussion \\n\\ndraft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in \\n\\nearly 2003.\\n\\n\\n\\nArguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, \\n\\nCanadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and \\n\\ncombat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting \\n\\nthese proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the \\n\\nCouncil of Europe's cybercrime treaty \\n\\n\", ', which the country is in the \\n\\nprocess of considering.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the \\n\\npossession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet \\n\\nproviders to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and \\n\\npermit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find \"hidden \\n\\nelectronic and digital devices\" that a suspect might be concealing. In \\n\\nmost circumstances, a court order would be required for government \\n\\nagents to conduct Internet monitoring.\\n\\n\\n\\nCanada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of \\n\\nEurope, and representatives from both countries\\' police agencies have \\n\\nendorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty \\n\\n', ', which has \\n\\ndrawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. \\n\\nOf nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted \\n\\n', ', \\n\\nor ratified, the treaty.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichael Geist ', ', a professor at the \\n\\nUniversity of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the \\n\\njustification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems \\n\\nweak.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It seems to me that the main justification they\\'ve given for all the \\n\\nchanges is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to \\n\\nmake changes,\" Geist said. \"To me that\\'s not a particularly convincing \\n\\nargument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, \\n\\nmake that case.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nGeist added that \"there\\'s nothing in the document that indicates (new \\n\\npowers) are needed. I don\\'t know that there have been a significant \\n\\nnumber of cases where police have run into problems.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nProbably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is \\n\\ncompelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure \\n\\ntheir networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention \\n\\norders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the \\n\\nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act \\n\\n', ', but it \\n\\napplies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and \\n\\nInternet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical \\n\\ncapability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national \\n\\nsecurity agencies,\" according to the proposal.

I, at least,\\n\\nhave almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, or\\n\\nselected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant,\\n\\nwhich appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY)\\n\\nwhere it shouldn\\'t - the previous selection should only be cleared\\n\\nwhen there\\'s something else to replace it (even if the highlighting\\n\\nof what is selected is removed).     Try this in any other ramdom\\n\\napplication (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  There\\n\\nnormally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary\\n\\nselection (that is, set it to be a null string).\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, because of the \"if I get asked for the selection value, I will\\n\\nfind something\" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert\\n\\npoint, the way most other GUI\\'s operate), and then paste, because the\\n\\nPRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing\\n\\nelse has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from\\n\\neither the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was\\n\\ndeleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal\\n\\n\"select stuff, click at new insert point, paste\" mode of operation\\n\\nthat almost everyone expects to work (whether the \"select stuff\"\\n\\nis somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere).\\n\\n\\n\\nkre\\n\\n\\n\\nps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I\\'ve never\\n\\nreally understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at that\\n\\npart of the code and see how it all really operates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\n\\nExmh-users mailing list\\n\\nExmh-users@redhat.com\\n\\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n']\n",

I\\'ve\\n\\n> seen examples of this already, where SA doesn\\'t score the spam high enough\\n\\n> to bounce it, but Razor does.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think perhaps you missed the fact that SA scores are adjustable.  If\\n\\nyou want SA to tag all messages listed in Razor then you can put this\\n\\nin your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file.\\n\\n\\n\\n  score RAZOR_CHECK 10\\n\\n\\n\\nThe default score is 3 and the default threshold needed is 5.\\n\\nTherefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by SA\\n\\nthen setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5\\n\\nwould be sufficient.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you are already using SA then the above would be more efficient.\\n\\nOtherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, once\\n\\nfor SA and once again afterward.  If you really want to run Razor\\n\\nindividually then you should set the \\'score RAZOR_CHECK 0\\' so that SA\\n\\nwon\\'t do it and avoid the double network hit.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor has\\n\\nbeen the history of false positive reports in the razor database.  The\\n\\ncurrent score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam.\\n\\nBut for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold.\\n\\nRazor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide\\n\\nof use as Razor1.\\n\\n\\n\\nBob\\n\\n\\n\\n--huq684BweRXVnRxX\\n\\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature\\n\\nContent-Disposition: inline\\n\\n\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.7 (GNU/Linux)\\n\\n\\n\\niD8DBQE9iV7k0pRcO8E2ULYRAjoAAJ97CB6LpbhPHqa8IJx1l4g/LRiVdwCfUZIB\\n\\nkUAK30zsRWL8PTb1TrEQuy8=\\n\\n=XVm6\\n\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\n\\n\\n--huq684BweRXVnRxX--\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\\n\\nWelcome to geek heaven.\\n\\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\n\\nRazor-users mailing list\\n\\nRazor-users@lists.sourceforge.net\\n\\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n']\n",

You call it from procmail, it adds a new\\n\\nheader, and then you can filter on that header.  Really easy.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s how I envision this working.  Everybody gets four new mailboxes:\\n\\n\\n\\n  train-eggs\\n\\n  train-spam\\n\\n  trained-eggs\\n\\n  trained-spam\\n\\n\\n\\nYou copy all your spam and eggs* into the \"train-\" boxes as you get it.\\n\\nHow frequently you do this would be up to you, but you\\'d get better\\n\\nresults if you did it more often, and you\\'d be wise to always copy over\\n\\nanything which was misclassified.  Then, every night, the spam fairy\\n\\nswoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of\\n\\nthings you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam.  After she\\'s\\n\\ndone, she moves your mail into the \"trained-\" folders.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read\\n\\ntheir mail right off the server.  I\\'ve spoken with some fellows at work\\n\\nabout Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports\\n\\nappropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail\\n\\nclient to bind the key \"S\" to \"move to train-spam\" and \"H\" to \"move to\\n\\ntrain-eggs\".  Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it\\'d\\n\\nstart showing up in mail clients.  That\\'s the \"delete as spam\" button\\n\\nPaul Graham was talking about.\\n\\n\\n\\n* The Hormel company might not think well of using the word \"ham\" as the\\n\\n  opposite of \"spam\", and they\\'ve been amazingly cool about the use of\\n\\n  their product name for things thus far.

The received and date headers helped the\\n\\nclassifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is\\n\\nnew.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,\\n\\nand x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-\\n\\nheaders that my mail reader added:\\n\\n\\n\\nclass MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):\\n\\n\\n\\n    skip = {\\'received\\': 1,\\n\\n            \\'date\\': 1,\\n\\n            \\'x-from_\\': 1,\\n\\n            }\\n\\n\\n\\n    def tokenize_headers(self, msg):\\n\\n        for k, v in msg.items():\\n\\n            k = k.lower()\\n\\n            if k in self.skip or k.startswith(\\'x-vm\\'):\\n\\n                continue\\n\\n            for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):\\n\\n                for t in tokenize_word(w):\\n\\n                    yield \"%s:%s\" % (k, t)\\n\\n\\n\\nThis did moderately better.

I poked around expedia for availability\\n\\nfrom March 26 to 29 (4 nights, wednesday thorugh saturday).  \\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve also started contacting hotels for group rates; some of the group\\n\\nrates are no better than the regular rates, and they require signing a\\n\\ncontract with a minimum number of rooms sold (with someone financially\\n\\nresponsible for unbooked rooms).  Most hotels are less than responsive...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tRadission - Barcelo Hotel (DuPont Circle)\\n\\n\\t$125/night, $99/weekend\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tState Plaza hotel (Foggy Bottom; near GWU)\\n\\n\\t$119/night, $99/weekend\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tHilton Silver Spring (Near Metro, in suburban MD)\\n\\n\\t$99/hight, $74/weekend\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tWindsor Park Hotel\\n\\n\\tConn Ave, between DuPont Circle/Woodley Park Metro stations\\n\\n\\t$95/night; needs a car\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tEcono Lodge Alexandria (Near Metro, in suburban VA)\\n\\n\\t$95/night\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a hand picked list; I ignored anything over $125/night, even\\n\\nthough there are some really well situated hotels nearby at higher rates.\\n\\nAlso, I\\'m not sure how much these prices reflect an expedia-only\\n\\ndiscount.  I can\\'t vouch for any of these hotels, either.\\n\\n\\n\\nI also found out that the down season for DC Hotels are mid-june through\\n\\nmid-september, and mid-november through mid-january.\\n\\n\\n\\nZ.\\n\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThis one has no MIME structure nor HTML!

I\\'m surprised $125/night and similar aren\\'t clues too.

      "['\\n\\nFrom: Bert\\n\\n\\n\\n01. I was so poor growing up...  if I wasn\\'t a boy...  I\\'d have had\\n\\n    nothing to play with.\\n\\n\\n\\n02. A girl phoned me the other day and said, \"Come on over; nobody\\'s\\n\\n    home.\"  I went over. Nobody was home.\\n\\n\\n\\n03. During sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me.  Just the\\n\\n    other night she called me from a hotel\\n\\n\\n\\n04. One day I came home early from work...  I saw a guy jogging\\n\\n    naked. I said to the guy, \"Hey buddy, why are you doing that?\"  He\\n\\n    said \"Because you came home early.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n05. It\\'s been a rough day. I got up this morning...  put a shirt on\\n\\n    and button fell off.  I picked up my briefcase, and the handle\\n\\n    came off.  I\\'m afraid to go to the bathroom.\\n\\n\\n\\n06. I was such an ugly kid...  When I played in the sandbox, the cat\\n\\n    kept covering me up.\\n\\n\\n\\n07. I could tell my parents hated me.  My bath toys were a toaster and\\n\\n    radio.\\n\\n\\n\\n08. I was such an ugly baby...  My mother never breast fed me. She\\n\\n    told me that she only liked me as a friend.\\n\\n\\n\\n09. I\\'m so ugly...  My father carries around a picture of the kid who\\n\\n    came with his wallet.\\n\\n\\n\\n10. When I was born, the doctor came into the waiting room and said to\\n\\n    my father, \"I\\'m sorry. We did everything we could, but he pulled\\n\\n    through.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n11. I\\'m so ugly...  My mother had morning sickness...  AFTER I was\\n\\n    born.\\n\\n\\n\\n12. I remember the time that I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of\\n\\n    my finger to my father.  He said he wanted more proof.\\n\\n\\n\\n13. Once when I was lost, I saw a policeman, and asked him to help me\\n\\n    find my parents. I said to him, \"Do you think we\\'ll ever find\\n\\n    them?\" He said,\"I don\\'t know kid. There\\'s so many places they can\\n\\n    hide.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n14. My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.\\n\\n\\n\\n15. I\\'m so ugly...  I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how\\n\\n    big I\\'d get.\\n\\n\\n\\n16. I went to see my doctor. \"Doctor, every morning when I get up and\\n\\n    I look in the mirror...  I feel like throwing up; What\\'s wrong\\n\\n    with me?\" He said...  \"I don\\'t know but your eyesight is perfect.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n17. I went to the doctor because I\\'d swallowed a bottle of sleeping\\n\\n    pills. My doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.\\n\\n\\n\\n18. With my old man I got no respect. I asked him, \"How can I get my\\n\\n    kite in the air?\" He told me to run off a cliff.\\n\\n\\n\\n19. Some dog I got. We call him Egypt because in every room he leaves\\n\\n    a pyramid. His favorite bone is in my arm.  Last night he went on\\n\\n    the paper four times - three of those times I was reading it.\\n\\n\\n\\n20. One year they wanted to make me poster boy - for birth control.\\n\\n\\n\\n21. My uncle\\'s dying wish was to have me sitting in his lap; he was in\\n\\n    the electric chair.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n']\n",
