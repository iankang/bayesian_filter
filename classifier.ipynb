      "> self-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation \n",
      "\n",
      "> ago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one \n",

      "\n",
      "> which customers were not permitted to ownand they were all the same \n",

      "\n",
      "> mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local \n",
      "\n",
      "> phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing \n",

      "\n",
      "> began by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new \n",
      "\n",
      "> telecom companies alive. \"In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is \n",
      "\n",
      "> often cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas,\" Powell said. \"Like the \n",

      "> Whos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast \n",

      "\n",
      "> financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications \n",
      "\n",

      "> wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and \n",
      "\n",
      "> if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national \n",

      "> duopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. \n",
      "\n",
      "> And these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the \n",

      "> poor health of the long-distance companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "> \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "> don't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more \n",

      "I am Mr.IKE EJOH. Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Bran\n",
