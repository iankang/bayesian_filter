      "\n",
      "DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \n",
      "\n",
      "called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \n",

      "data.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \n",
      "\n",
      "conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \n",
      "\n",
      "proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \n",

      "\"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up \n",
      "\n",
      "to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \n",
      "\n",
      "application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \n",
      "\n",
      "alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \n",

      "security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \n",
      "\n",
      "processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company \n",
      "\n",
      "itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \n",
      "\n",
      "and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \n",
      "\n",
      "creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \n",
      "\n",
      "adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly \n",
      "\n",
      "said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \n",
      "\n",
      "technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \n",
      "\n",
      "will be mostly false.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \n",
      "\n",
      "accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, \n",
      "\n",
      "while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes \n",
      "\n",
      "and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of \n",
      "\n",
      "XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \n",
      "\n",
      "as they pass through the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \n",
      "\n",
      "balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \n",
      "\n",
      "and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application \n",

      "\n",
      "> to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of an ongoing NASA/UAH joint project, Dr. John Christy of UAH and Dr. Roy Spencer of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center use data gathered by microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration TIROS-N satellites to get accurate, direct measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the Earth, including remote deserts, rain forests and oceans for which reliable temperature data are not otherwise available.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data. A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a \"public\" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "GATHERING THE DATA\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their \"brightness\" - varies according to temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a \"remarkable\" level of agreement between the two.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by \"radiosonde\" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement,\" Christy said. \"If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23° Fahrenheit) per decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet,\" Christy said. \"They are not representative of the total globe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05° C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.\n",

      "GLOBAL COVERAGE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. \"Radiosonde\" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard \"ships of opportunity.\" The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.\n",

      "Of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local \"asphalt effect\" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.\n",

      "Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weve never seen anything like it!\n",

      "XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a \"mass source to advertising sector \" live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the companys strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Their \"source to business model\", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon.\n",
